Spotify is an audio streaming platform launched on 7 October 2008. 
As of Febrauary 2019, 203 million Spotify's users love playing music in headphones and speakers across all continents around the world and are represented by 78 countries. 

In this analysis, we will look at Spotify's Top 50 songs in the most populous countries in each continent and deterimine if the songs' popularity is correlated with their danceability, energy, genre, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, and liveliness.

Hypothesis 1: if top 50 playlist in each country is driven by popularity and dancibility, then majority of the songs in the list will have dancibility score between 0.7 - 1.0 and popularity score between 70 - 100.

Hypothesis 1.1: if top 50 playlist in each country is driven by popularity and dancibility, then average dancibility and popularity scores of the playlist will have high values across the countries. 

Hypothesis 1.1.1: If a country's top 50 songs' average danceability score is significantly higher than the danceability score of the "average popular song" (among 13 countries), then that country prefers more danceable songs than the average country.

HYPOTHESIS FINAL: If a country’s top-50 playlist is related to the danceability and worldwide popularity of the individual songs, then a majority of the songs in each country’s list will have a danceability score between 0.7 - 1.0 and a popularity score between 70 - 100.

What is the average dancibility?






Hypothesis 2: if top 50 playlist in each country is driven by popularity of certain genre then the most of the artists in the list will represent that genre.  

Hypothesis 2.1: If a given country's top 50 artists' genres differ significantly from the average genre distribution...
