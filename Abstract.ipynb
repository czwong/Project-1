    "### Questions to answer:\n",
    "- Are there any correlations between genres, audio feature (focus on danceability, energy) and popularity?\n",
    "    Do certain types of songs stay longer on the TOP 50 charts?\n",
    "    Limitation - we don't have access to the TOP 50 songs ofe prior months. We only have access to today's top 50 songs. So we can look at the release dates.\n",
    "- Use ANOVA to check for statistical significance between popularity, danceability across all countries.\n",
    "- Conduct chi test to see how likely the significance is occured by chance\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent - audio features, popularity\n",
    "Independent - song, genre\n",
