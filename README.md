# Project-1


## Data Collection

* [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - Where we collected our data from
* [Converting To Excel with Playlist ID](link to github jn) - Pulling from Spotify's API
1. We created an excel sheet that listed the playlist IDs of each country's Top 50 Songs, which we pulled directly from the Spotify application. See [Top 50 playlists](link to github jn).
2. We used nested for loops to pull audio data for each track in each country's playlist.
* [Datasets](link to github jn) - CSV outputs of each country's top 50 playlist
* [Clean up](link to github jn) - How we cleaned our data

## Data Exploration
* [Danceability by Country](link to github jn) - Loops through each country's playlist data to examine danceability scores. See [box plot](link to github png)
* [Genre Popularity in US](link to github jn) - Loops through the Top 50 Songs of the US to count and display all genres in the playlist. See [bar graph](link to github png)
* [Danceability scores of the top 3 genres in the US](link to github png) - Pop, Rap and Trap dominates the charts.
* [Genre Popularity by Country](link to github jn) - Loops through each country's playlist data to count the number times pop, rap, trap and other genres show up in the top charts. See [bar graph](link to github png)
