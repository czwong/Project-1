## Data Collection

* [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - Where we collected our data from
* [Converting To Excel with Playlist ID](link to github jn) - Pulling from Spotify's API
	* We created an excel sheet that listed the playlist IDs of each country's Top 50 Songs, which we pulled directly from the Spotify application. See [Top 50 playlists](link to github jn).
	* We used nested for loops to pull audio data for each track in each country's playlist.
* [Datasets](link to github jn) - CSV outputs of each country's top 50 playlist
* [Clean up](link to github jn) - How we cleaned our data

## Data Exploration
* [Danceability by Country](link to github jn) - Loops through each country's playlist data to examine danceability scores. See [box plot](https://github.com/czwong/Project-1/blob/master/Images/Danceability__Per_Country_Boxplot.png)
* [Genre Popularity in US](link to github jn) - Loops through the Top 50 Songs of the US to count and display all genres in the playlist. See [bar graph](link to github png)
* [Danceability scores of the top 3 genres in the US](https://github.com/czwong/Project-1/blob/master/Images/Top_3_Genre_Danceability_in_US_Boxplot.png) - Pop, Rap and Trap dominates the charts.
* [Genre Popularity by Country](https://github.com/czwong/Project-1/blob/master/Genre%20Popularity%20Around%20the%20World.ipynb) - Loops through each country's playlist data to count the number times pop, rap, trap and other genres show up in the top charts.
